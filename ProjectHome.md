# Cancer Genomics Linkage Application #

## Introduction ##

The Cancer Genomics Linkage Application will enable the integration and re-use of the cancer genomics data available from public repositories such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). This will be accomplished through the capability being developed by the “Early Activity” of the Genomics Virtual Laboratory (GVL-EA). It will enable researchers, such as Professors Andrew Biankin, John Mattick (Garvan Institute for Medical Research) or Sean Grimmond (Queensland Centre for Medical Genomics), to access genomic datasets of international importance and to integrate them with their own clinical and genomic datasets in order to explore, discover and validate key genomic abnormality that cause cancer. The product will further provide the mechanism for such researchers to publish and to make available their analysis for re-use by the community.

The product aims to provide the ability for biologists and clinicians to easily integrate their own research data with datasets from multiple data sources. The Integration of the datasets into a common location and enabling access and mining using best practice workflow tools will enable the Australian cancer researchers to accelerate their discovery processes and to be internationally competitive. Although this project will have a particular focus on pancreatic cancer research as carried out by the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative (APGI), the application can also support the wider cancer research community.
